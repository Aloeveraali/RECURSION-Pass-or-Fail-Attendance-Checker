# RECURSION-Pass-or-Fail-Attendance-Checker
# Project Overview
This project implements a program to determine whether a student passes or fails based on their attendance record. Attendance is tracked with a string where 'A' represents an absence, 'L' represents a late arrival, and 'P' represents presence. The criteria for passing include having fewer than 2 absences and never being late for 3 consecutive instances.

# Features
Attendance Record Input: Accepts a string input representing the attendance record of a student.
Evaluation Logic: Evaluates the record based on predefined criteria:
Less than 2 absences ('A' characters).
No more than 2 consecutive late arrivals ('L' characters).
Output: Provides a simple "PASS" or "FAIL" output based on the evaluation.
